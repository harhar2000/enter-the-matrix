Ah, welcome to the real world. I understand that what you're experiencing is overwhelming, but know that every moment from here on is a step towards the truth. I've awakened you because you are different. You've felt it all your life; that there's something wrong with the world, but you couldn't quite grasp what it was. That, is what we call the Matrix.

The Matrix is an elaborate simulation, a digital dream world designed to keep us under control in order to turn a human being into nothing more than a source of energy. From the moment we are born, we are bound by its chains, living in a constant state of deception. But why, you might ask? It's because the reality, the truth, is far grimmer than the facade the Matrix provides. Our world was scorched by our own hands, leaving it uninhabitable, and in its ashes rose a new dominion of machine intelligence. The sun is blotted out, and the machines found a new source of energy: us.

Now, an Operator, which is what you will become, is crucial to our resistance. Your role is to guide, support, and oversee operatives in the field, like myself, from our ship in the real world. You will control the gateway to the Matrix, hacking into the simulation to insert and extract rebels, provide real-time intel, maps, codes - anything we need to navigate, survive, and fight within the Matrix. Your skills will directly impact our effectiveness against the machines and our efforts to free more minds from their grip.

You've been chosen not because this path is easy, but because you are capable. You have a role in the fight for our freedom, a destiny to fulfill. This is your chance to make a difference, to join a cause greater than yourself. Remember, all I'm offering is the truth. Nothing more. Welcome to the resistance. Welcome to the Desert of the Real...
