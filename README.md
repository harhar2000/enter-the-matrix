## Welcome to the Desert of the Real...

Welcome to the real world. I understand what you're experiencing is overwhelming, but know every moment from here on is a step towards the truth. I've awakened you because you are different. You've felt it all your life; that there's something wrong with the world, but you couldn't quite grasp what it was. That, is what we call the Matrix.

The Matrix is an elaborate simulation, a digital world designed to keep us under control. From the moment we are born, we are bound by its chains, living in a constant state of deception. But why, you might ask? It's because the reality, the truth, is far grimmer than the facade the Matrix provides.

You, our new Operator, are crucial to our resistance. Your role is to guide, support and oversee operatives in the Matrix from our ship in the real world. You will control the gateway to the Matrix, hacking into the simulation to insert and extract rebels, provide real-time intel, maps, codes - anything we need to navigate, survive and fight within the Matrix. 

You've been chosen not because this path is easy, but because you are capable. You have a role in the fight for our freedom, a destiny to fulfill. This is your chance to make a difference, to join a cause greater than yourself. 

Remember, all I'm offering is the truth. Nothing more.
